Instructions: This is the template you may use to type up your responses to the exercises and the on your own questions. Within RStudeo, to produce a document that you can print out and turn in just click on Knit HTML above. All you need to do to complete the lab is to type up your BRIEF answers and the R code (when necessary) in the spaces provided below. 

To use the min.css formatting, leave the css file mentioned in the YAML section of the document. Otherwise, I suggest a simple Bootstrap theme. 


# Question 1
Classification is to prdict what class the variable belows to, whereas Regression predicts a continuous value.
For example given a persons family history of diabetes, health condition,food habits we can predict if that person may have diabates  in future(categorical) , this is classfication.
Given a computers configuration and brand , one can predict its price(price), this is regression.

Regression and classification are similar as both of them predict a value depending on the other variable values

# Q2

The census data can be downloaded from the [UCI ML site](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Census+Income) and loaded using the `read.csv` command.  Alternatively, it can be read directly from the UCI site (follow the example used in the Exploratory Analysis examples).

```{r}
adult <- read.csv("adult.data.txt",header=F, na.strings="?")
```

Inline r code can be inserted as `r adult[1,1]`.  
This can also be used in a table:

|       |  Var 1              |  Var 3              | 
|-------|---------------------|---------------------|
| Mean  | `r mean(adult[,1])` | `r mean(adult[,3])` | 
| Max   | `r max(adult[,1])`  | `r max(adult[,3])`  |

## Q2d(iV)

Observations from the graph
Histograms
Number of persons with label <=50k is decreasing consistently from age 20 to 80.The number of people with label <=50K is highest for the age group 20-25 and lowest for age group 85 to 90.
but for label >50k , There is a consistent increase in of people iwth > 50 k label from the age 20 to 45 and from there, we can see a consistent decrease.The number of people with label >50K is highest for the age group 40to 45 and lowest for age group 85 to 90.

The number of people with label <=50 k has increased inconsistently with working hours per week . Maximum number of people with label <=50k are working for 35 to 40 hours and minimum number of people are working for 90 to 95 hours per week

The number of people with label >50K has increased inconsistently with working hours per week . Maximum number of people with label >50k are working for 35 to 40 hours and minimum number of people are working for 90 to 95 hours per week 


BoxPlots for Age
The median is people with lable <=50K with age around  age 37.
First quartile is from age 15 to around 24 
second quartile is from age around 24 to 35.
third quartile is from age 35 to 45
fourth quartile is from age 45 to 80

The median is people with lable >50K with age around age 42.
First quartile is from age 20 to around 35 
second quartile is from age around 35 to 42.
third quartile is from age 42 to 55
fourth quartile is from age 55 to 75

BoxPlots for hours per week
The median is people with lable <=50K are working for 40 hours per week.
First quartile is from hours 28 to around 38
second quartile is from hours around 38 to 40.
third quartile is around people working for 40 hours
fourth quartile is from working hours 40 to 48

The median is people with lable >50K are working for 40 hours per week.
First quartile is from hours 23 to 4o hours
second quartile are people working around 40 hours
third quartile is around people working for 40 to 48 hours
fourth quartile is from working hours 48 to 65

##  Q2e(iii)

From the histograms
Workclass with private job are more in number
MAles are more than females
Private job employees have the most  labe<= 50k and label >50k
femals with <50K are more than >50k label
Males are almost same number of label <=50k and >50k


##  Q2f(i)

```{r}
library(ggplot2)
ggplot(adult,aes(V1,V2))+geom_point()
```

Seeing the plot we can say that age and workclass are independent of eachother.As every workclass value is plotted to almost every age group 
```{r}
library(ggplot2)
ggplot(adult,aes(V1,V6))+geom_point()
```

Seeing the plot we can say that age and martial status are independetn of eachother.As every martial status value is plotted to almost every age group 


##  Q2f(ii)

```{r}
plot(adult$V1,adult$V13)
```

Hours per week increased from age group 20-30 and was consistent upto 60 and from 60 it decreased

## Q3-f
`r plot(auto$mpg,auto$displacement,xlab="mpg",ylab="displacement")`

As mpg is increasing , the displacement is decreasing
mpg and displacement are inversely proportional

`r plot(HP,auto$displacement,xlab="horsepower",ylab="displacement")`

As horsepower is increasing the displacement is increasing
horsepower and displacement are directly proportional

`r plot(auto$weight,auto$displacement,xlab="weight",ylab="displacement")`

As weight is increasing the displacement is increasing.
weight and  displacement are directly proportional

## Q3-g
`r plot(auto$cylinders,auto$mpg,xlab="cylinders",ylab="mpg")`

As mpg is increasing the cylinders number 
is decreasing but not consistently . Like 
for mpg aound 15 to 20 we have 3,4,5,6 
cylinder cars.But at mpg=40 we have 4 
cylinders but not 3.So cylinders willnot be 
useful for mpg prediction.

`r plot(auto$displacement,auto$mpg,xlab="displacement",ylab="mpg")`

There is a consistent decrease in mpg with
increase in displacement with very few 
outliers. So displacement can be useful for 
prediction  of mpg.


`r plot(HP,auto$mpg,xlab="horsepower",ylab="mpg")`

ignoring 0 or missing values. mpg has a 
consistent decrease with increase in 
horsepower. And we cand say mpg is 
inversely proportional to horsepower.So horsepower can be useful for prediction of mpg

`r plot(auto$weight,auto$mpg,xlab="weight",ylab="mpg")`

mpg has a consistent decrease with increase in weight. And we can say mpg is 
inversely proportional to weight.So weight can be useful for prediction of mpg

`r plot(auto$acceleration,auto$mpg,xlab="acceleration",ylab="mpg")`

mpg and acceleration plot is very scattered.Low acceleration(around 10) have low mpg .but as acceleration increases the mpg is more scattered.acceleration cannot be a good factor for predication

`r plot(auto$year,auto$mpg,xlab="year",ylab="mpg")`

We cant use year as factor for prediction of mpg. The graph is way to scattered. every year has almost all mpg.

`r plot(auto$origin,auto$mpg,xlab="origin",ylab="mpg")`

origin cannot be a factor of prediction of mpg. clearly from the graoh every origin has alomost all the mpg values

So in conclusion amongst all the variable displacement,horsepower and weight can be best suited for predicting mpg.
